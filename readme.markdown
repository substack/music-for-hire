# music for hire

Does your event need experimental, live-coded, completely original algorithmic
music? Perfect for tech conferences, birthday parties, corporate events, and
more!

Do you need custom electronic music or effects? Perfect for video games, crowd
funding videos, promotional materials, podcasts, and cyberpunk noir cinema.

Do you employ programmers?  We code and make music at the same time.  Our music is perfect for coding environments.  Hire an algorithm DJ for an afternoon set.  Live or remote, it's code!

I am located in Oakland, CA, USA but I will fly to wherever you are, anywhere in
the world! I have a squad of [collaborators](https://soundcloud.com/folkstack).
